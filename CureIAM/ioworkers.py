    """Run concurrent input/output workers with specified functions.

    A two-level hierarchy of workers are created using both
    multiprocessing as well as multithreading. At first, ``processes``
    number of worker processes are created. Then within each process
    worker, ``threads`` number of worker threads are created. Thus, in
    total, ``processes * threads`` number of worker threads are created.

    Arguments:
        input_func (callable): A callable which when called yields
            tuples. Each tuple must represent arguments to be passed to
            ``output_func``.
        output_func (callable): A callable that can accept as arguments
            an unpacked tuple yielded by ``input_func``. When called,
            this callable must work on the arguments and return an
            output value. This callable must not return ``None`` for any
            input.
        processes (int): Number of worker processes to run. If
            unspecified or ``0`` or negative integer is specified, then
            the number returned by :func:`os.cpu_count` is used.
        threads (int): Number of worker threads to run in each process.
            If unspecified or ``0`` or negative integer is specified,
            then `5` multiplied by the number returned by
            :func:`os.cpu_count` is used.
        log_tag (str): String to include in every log message. This
            helps in differentiating between different workers invoked
            by different callers.

    Yields:
        Each output value returned by ``output_func``.
